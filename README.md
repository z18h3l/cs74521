java cAssessment Task 3 – Quantitative Risk Assessment and Decision Making Part A Introduction 
For a person from Tianjin, the Tianjin Port explosion was a very serious engineering incident. On 12 August 2015, a fire occurred in a warehouse building in Tianjin Port because hazardous chemicals were not properly stored. Because of this event, two huge explosions occurred, causing many deaths, massive property damage, and environmental degradation.
The purpose of this paper is to use the Tianjin Port explosion as an example to understand the main factors that led to the disaster and to discuss how to prevent similar mistakes from happening again.1.Case study overview 
1.1 Incident Loss
As a result of the accident, 165 people were killed, 8 people were missing, 798 people were injured; 304 buildings, 12,428 commercial vehicles and 7,533 containers were damaged. Direct economic losses 6,866 million RMB. － Ministry of Emergency Management of People’s Republic of China investigation
report, 2015.
1.2 Summary of the incident
At around 23:34 on August 12, 2015, there was a series of explosions of flammable and explosive products in containers at the container terminal of the Ruihai International Logistics Center in Tianjin Port, Binhai New Area, Tianjin City.
The direct cause of the dangerous goods container nitrocellulose local drying, under the action of high temperature and other factors to accelerate the decomposition of exothermic, spontaneous combustion of heat accumulation, and finally to other hazardous chemicals such as ammonium nitrate and other hazardous chemicals to explode! 
1.3 The timeline of the event 
The initial fire occurred at 22:51:46 on August 12, 2015, and initially started in the middle of the container area on the south side of the arrivals area of Ruihai's hazardous materials warehouse. The weather was dry and hot at the time of the incident, which led to the decomposition of nitrocellulose cotton in the dangerous goods containers and the spontaneous combustion of the accumulated heat.
At 22:52 on the night of the accident, the 110 Command Center of Tianjin Public Security Bureau received an alarm that a fire had occurred in the dangerous goods stack of Ruihai Logistics of Tianjin Binhai New Area Port Group and referred the alarm to the Fire Brigade of Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau.
Then the Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade immediately dispatched the Tianjin Port Fire Brigade No. 4, which is the closest to Ruihai Company, to rush to the scene.
At 22:56, Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade No. 4 arrived at the scene first. The commander of the scene requested the Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade for reinforcement.
At 23:08 , 6 active public security squadrons of Tianjin Fire Brigade and 3 full-time fire brigades of Tianjin Port, with 36 fire engines and 200 people, participated in fire-fighting and rescue. Meanwhile, more firefighters are still on their way.
At about 23:34 , two strong explosions occurred at the fire. The first explosion occurred at 23:34:06. The Ministry of Emergency Management of People’s Republic of China investigation report attributed the cause of the first explosion to the high temperature of the nitrocellulose combustion leading to the decomposition and explosion of the surrounding ammonium nitrate, with an explosive equivalent of 15 tons of TNT.
At 23:34:37, the fire scene occurred a larger second explosion, Ministry of Emergency Management of People’s Republic of China investigation report said the second explosion equivalent to 430 tons of TNT.
The explosion, which raised smoke and dust up to tens of meters high at the time, caused 12 firefighters to die and 36 firefighters to be lost. 30 fire engines were destroyed in the accident.
The two explosions formed a small crescent-shaped crater 15 meters in diameter and 1.1 meters deep, and a large circular crater 97 meters in diameter and 2.7 meters deep, with an average of more than 40 times the toxic substances in the crater, and more than 800 times the sodium cyanide.
1.5 Setting Clear Boundaries  
1.5.1 Boundaries in Time  
Start Date: The study starts on August 12, 2015, the day of the explosion. It looks at things that happened before the disaster, like how the dangerous materials were stored and handled.  
End Date: The study will look at what happened after the explosion, including the first responses and results of the investigation,  all the way through to the end of 2015.  
1.5.2 Boundaries of Geography  
The main focus will be on the Ruihai International Logistics Company's warehouse for dangerous goods at the Tianjin Port, which is where the blast happened. 
Secondary Locations: The study will also look at the larger Tianjin Port area, as well as the communities and structures that were touched by explosion in the area around it.  
1.5.3 Technology and Systems  
Hazardous Material Storage and Management System: This includes the places to store chemicals, the ways to handle them, and the people who are in charge of all of these things.  
Firefighting and Emergency Response Systems: It is about what to do right after an explosion, including what firefighting gear to use and what to do in an emergency.  
Urban planning and safety design: This includes the planning of space and safety issues that come up when putting dangerous goods stores close to residential and business areas.  
1.5.4 Limits in Social and Economic Life  
Direct Effects: The study will look at the direct effects on people who are close by, such as warehouse workers, first responders, locals, and b代 写Assessment Task 3 – Quantitative Risk Assessment and Decision Making Part AMatlab
